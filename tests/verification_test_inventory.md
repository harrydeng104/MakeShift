# Verification Test Inventory

Every verification test for MakeShift. Test Case IDs and Req. IDs match the
RVTM. Tests added since the RVTM are marked **Added** and numbered after the
RVTM tests for the same requirement. Update this table in the same PR that
adds, changes, or wires a test into CI (see `AGENTS.md`).

- **Implementation Status** records whether test code or a completed manual procedure
  exists: Implemented, Partially implemented, Planned, or Blocked. CI integration
  and execution results are separate; a successful build is not a test result.
- **Evidence Link** points to a specific Actions job log or completed manual report.
  Source links identify implementations, not passing runs. Proposed dates below
  are planning estimates requested by the user, not completion claims or
  confirmed commitments from individual owners.
- **Owners:** Carl Xu owns audio and latency/performance tests; Jadden Picardal
  owns UI behavior, accessibility, navigation, and tutorial content; Francis Ozua
  owns CV detection and geometry; Harry Deng owns MIDI and remaining checks.
  Cross-subsystem tests use the behavior being asserted: audio output goes to
  Carl, visible recording controls to Jadden, MIDI file behavior to Harry.
- Defect IDs (D1, D2, ...) refer to the Known Defects table in
  [`README.md`](README.md).

### Implementation and evidence audit (2026-09-17)

Compared the local suite files with GitHub `main` at
`e34d73624c4d776cb2dd7c4e23a5f1d7d37ce33a` and inspected Actions job logs.
The six MIDI rows (4.1.3–4.1.7 and 4.2.3) represent seven existing unit tests;
they are implemented but Vitest is not invoked by the frontend workflow (D3).
No additional implementations were found for the remaining planned tests.
Test 1.1.4 describes planned geometry tests, not existing coverage. Test 2.2.2
has related rendering assertions, but pitch and volume/velocity ratio checks
remain missing. No completed manual reports exist.

The linked audio run reports 12 passes and two skipped stream tests; the contrast
job passes 18 token pairs; the RCA job passes 18 mocked tests. These runs predate
the local test relocation, so their logs use the old paths. They establish
historical execution, not CI validation of the uncommitted relocation.

## Proposed delivery schedule: September 17–November 20, 2026

The ready date is the target for test implementation and fixtures to be ready for
review; for manual tests it means the procedure and equipment are ready.
The CI / first-run date allows time for review, integration, and the first recorded
execution. It is not a guaranteed passing date. Tests remain Blocked until their
prerequisites are delivered. Product implementation dates below are assumptions
for planning, not evidence that another issue is complete.

- **09-17–09-25:** finish relocation, connect existing MIDI tests to CI, establish
  Selenium/fake-camera fixtures, verify hardware audio, and add geometry tests.
- **09-28–10-16:** test calibration and recording states, implement missing audio
  pitch/ratio assertions, and verify octave/note selection and MIDI persistence.
  Assume calibration fixes, pause/resume, and volume transport arrive before
  their respective test-ready dates; collision detection and labeled videos
  must be available by 10-14.
- **10-19–10-30:** connect collision, audio playback, and dynamics; verify file
  controls, overlays, and layouts. Assume browser audio transport is ready by
  10-23 and a deployed staging site is available by 10-28.
- **11-02–11-10:** first full latency, dynamics, accessibility, HTTPS, loading,
  and clean-browser runs after integration is stable.
- **11-11–11-18:** reserve for defect fixes and dependent test reruns across all
  four owners; rerun existing suites as well as new coverage on the release candidate.
- **11-19–11-20:** review evidence, skipped/blocked coverage, and requirement
  traceability; use 11-20 as the final evidence handoff target.

Related tests may share a harness or session (for example, the three tutorial
reviews). The buffer is deliberate: a late dependency moves its downstream tests,
not their implementation status. Review progress at Wednesday team meetings and
revise these estimates if feature delivery or equipment availability slips.
Already implemented RCA tests remain in CI; Harry should verify the relocated
suite with the other CI reruns on 09-23 and during final regression.

## Browser architecture reconciliation (#85)

The [RVTM addendum](../docs/rvtm_browser_addendum.md) maps existing requirements
to the [browser architecture](../docs/architecture.md). Planned browser tests
below use local events and AudioWorklet output rather than server audio transport.
Native test IDs and historical evidence remain unchanged. This documentation
update adds no executed tests and does not advance implementation/CI status.
Existing proposed dates remain planning estimates, not renewed commitments.

## Supporting CI Checks

These checks guard code quality. They do not verify a requirement on their own.

| Check | Owner | Workflow | Runs on |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ESLint, `tsc --noEmit`, `next build` | Jadden Picardal | `frontend-ci.yml` | Changes under `frontend/` or `tests/frontend/` |
| Ruff, mypy | Harry Deng | `linting.yml` | Python changes |
| clang-format 17 | Carl Xu | `linting.yml` | C++ changes under `backend/src` |
| `tests/python/test_dummy.py` | Harry Deng | `testing.yml` | Placeholder so pytest collects a test. Replace it once Python code exists |

## RCA Automation Verification

These are repository-process tests for [issue #81](https://github.com/Kakrl/MakeShift/issues/81),
not new product requirements. They do not replace any RVTM tests above.
All run with `node --test tests/automation/rca.test.cjs`; GitHub API calls are mocked.
A live post-merge publication is not claimed by these tests.

## Validation (not verification)

User acceptance testing follows the V&V plan: at least 4 diverse subjects, run
twice (after the first milestone and at the end of the semester). Record
results with the manual test template.

## Shared browser contract verification (#86)

These added tests cover the shared event boundary. Full CV-to-sound test 2.1.2,
physical latency tests 2.3.1/2.3.2, visible UI test 3.2.1 and recording lifecycle
4.1.1 remain blocked/planned; event fixtures do not complete those workflows.
All rows below ran locally on Windows on 2026-09-22. Vitest is not invoked by
CI (D3); Actions execution remains pending. No new requirement is introduced.
